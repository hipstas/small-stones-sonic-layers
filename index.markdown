<p>Kaie Kellough, Kevin Yuen Kit Lo, and Jason Sharp have created this stunning audio-visual experience, "Small Stones," hosted on SpokenWeb's Archive of the Present. The following annotations are a gesture towards identifying the ways in which the audio layers of this piece interact, intersect, and intercede one another from the perspective of sound design and audio layering. It is recommended to listen with headphones in order to experience the full stereo width of the piece.</p>
 
 <p>Please note that in the interest of faciliating a focus on sound design, these annotations consider the auditory layers of the work only; the visual/typographical elements are not reflected in this project.</p>
